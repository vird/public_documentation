# Overview

## Accessible Toolkit

TON Labs SDK comes with tools and features helping [TON Dev](https://ton.dev/) developers to:

- Compile smart contracts into the TVC format

> See the [Toolchain documentation](/Compilers/About/) for detailed information about TON Labs compilers. For additional information on the TVC format, refer to the original TON blockchain documentation. 

- Deploy, run, test and debug smart contracts using a local Node Server (Node SE);
- Quickly and easily interact with blockchain data and track changes.

## **Components**

- **TON Labs Local Node** – Debug and test your smart contracts in a controlled environment with an instance that acts just like a production node.
- **TON Labs Compiler Kit** – Compile TVC files from Solidity source code and from C using our LLVM-based solution. 
- **TON Labs Client Libraries** – An open standard to develop smart contract and test them locally.
- TON Dev CLI that glues the components together and enables smooth installation and development. 

Each TON Labs Client Library includes:

- **Crypto** – TON-related cryptography functions.
- **Contracts** - smart contract deployment and management.
- **Queries** – monitoring and querying blockchain data in real time.

## Prerequisites 

To use the product, you need a machine that supports [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). All the necessary docker images are available at docker hub. You also have to install one of the newest stable versions of Node.js. 

Any supported development/runtime environment can run TON Labs Client Libraries installed with the proper package manager.

> **Warning**: Docker utilizes a built-in virtual machine management component called Hyper-V to run itself. It is not a feature of Windows Home edition. Therefore, the solution cannot be installed on Windows Home Edition. All the other Windows editions fit the required criteria. 

> **Tip**: If you are a Windows Home user, try installing a VM according to the doc [here](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/69f25e).
