## Unsupported/Irrelevant

Supporting features and feature groups from this category has low priority or is out of the project scope, mainly because they are EVM-specific. 

In some cases we suggest a workaround. 

Depending on the project progress, we may decide to provide support for some of these at later stages.

Strings can not be implemented before data storage on TON TVM is completely supported. At this point, we do not support data storage completely.

It is planned to implement mapping connecting text representation of an instruction to its numerical counterpart. On the total, there are 476 instructions.
